It has three positions, OFF, ACC, and RUN. To change the ignition positions without starting the ve- hicle and use the accessories follow these steps: • Starting with the ignition in the OFF position, • Push the ENGINE START/STOP button once to place the ignition to the ACC position (instrument cluster will display “ACC”), • Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a second time to place the ignition to the RUN position (instrument cluster will display “ON/RUN”), • Push the ENGINE START/STOP button a third time to return the ignition to the OFF position (instrument cluster will display “OFF”). Cold Weather Operation (Below –22°F Or −30°C) To ensure reliable starting at these temperatures, use of an externally powered electric engine block heater (available from your authorized dealer) is recommended. After Starting — Warming Up The Engine The idle speed is controlled automatically and it will decrease as the engine warms up. If Engine Fails To Start WARNING! • Never pour fuel or other flammable liquid into the throttle body air inlet opening in an attempt to start the vehicle. This could result in flash fire causing serious personal injury. • Do not attempt to push or tow your vehicle to get it started. Vehicles equipped with an automatic trans- mission cannot be started this way. Unburned fuel could enter the catalytic converter and once the engine has started, ignite and damage the converter and vehicle. • If the vehicle has a discharged battery, booster cables may be used to obtain a start from a booster battery or the battery in another vehicle. This type of start can be dangerous if done improperly. Refer to “Jump-Starting Procedure” in “In Case Of Emer- gency” for further information. 328 STARTING AND OPERATING'},\n",

WARNING! Remember to disconnect the engine block heater cord before driving. Damage to the 110-115 Volt electrical cord could cause electrocution. ENGINE BREAK-IN RECOMMENDATIONS A long break-in period is not required for the engine and drivetrain (transmission and axle) in your vehicle. Drive moderately during the first 300 miles (500 km). After the initial 60 miles (100 km), speeds up to 50 or 55 mph (80 or 90 km/h) are desirable. While cruising, brief full-throttle acceleration within the limits of local traffic laws contributes to a good break-in. Wide-open throttle acceleration in low gear can be detri- mental and should be avoided. The engine oil installed in the engine at the factory is a high-quality energy conserving type lubricant. Oil changes should be consistent with anticipated climate conditions under which vehicle operations will occur. For the recom- mended viscosity and quality grades, refer to “Dealer Service” in “Servicing And Maintenance”. CAUTION! Never use Non-Detergent Oil or Straight Mineral Oil in the engine or damage may result. NOTE: A new engine may consume some oil during its first few thousand miles (kilometers) of operation. This should be considered a normal part of the break-in and not interpreted as a problem. 330 STARTING AND OPERATING'},\n",

The park brake is primarily intended to prevent the vehicle from rolling while parked. Before leaving the vehicle, make sure that the park brake is applied. Also, be certain to leave the transmission in PARK. You can engage the park brake in two ways; • Manually, by applying the park brake switch. • Automatically, by enabling the Auto Park Brake feature in the customer programmable features section of the Uconnect Settings. The park brake switch is located in the integrated center stack. To apply the park brake manually, push the switch mo- mentarily. You may hear a slight whirring sound from the back of the vehicle while the park brake engages. Once the park brake is fully engaged, the BRAKE warning lamp in the instrument cluster and an indicator on the switch will illuminate. If your foot is on the brake pedal while you apply the park brake, you may notice a small amount of brake pedal movement. The park brake can be applied even when the ignition switch is OFF, however, it can only be released when the ignition switch in the ACC or ON/RUN position.

Once the park brake is engaged, the BRAKE warning lamp in the instrument cluster and the LED indicator on the switch will illuminate. If your foot is on the brake pedal, you may notice a small amount of brake pedal movement while the parking brake is engaging. The park brake will release automatically when the igni- tion is cycled to the ON/RUN position, the transmission is in DRIVE or REVERSE, and the driver seat belt is buckled and an attempt is made to drive the vehicle away by pressing the accelerator pedal. To release the parking brake manually, the ignition switch must be in the ON/RUN position. Press on the brake pedal, then push the park brake switch momentarily. You may hear a slight whirring sound from the back of the vehicle while the parking brake disengages. You may also notice a small amount of movement in the brake pedal. Once the park brake is fully disengaged, the BRAKE warning lamp in the instrument cluster and the LED indicator on the switch will extinguish. NOTE: When parking on a hill, it is important to turn the front wheels toward the curb on a downhill grade and away from the curb on an uphill grade. Apply the park brake before placing the gear selector in PARK, otherwise the load on the transmission locking mechanism may make it difficult to move the gear selector out of PARK. The park brake should always be applied whenever the driver is not in the vehicle. WARNING! • Never use the PARK position as a substitute for the parking brake. Always apply the parking brake fully when parked to guard against vehicle movement and possible injury or damage. • When exiting the vehicle, always make sure the ignition is in the OFF mode, remove the key fob from the vehicle, and lock your vehicle. • Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle. Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons. A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured. Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the trans- mission gear selector. (Continued) 332 STARTING AND OPERATING'},\n",

Also be certain to leave the transmission in PARK. Failure to do so may allow the vehicle to roll and cause damage or injury. • Driving the vehicle with the parking brake engaged, or repeated use of the parking brake to slow the vehicle may cause serious damage to the brake system. CAUTION! If the Brake System Warning Light remains on with the parking brake released, a brake system malfunction is indicated. Have the brake system serviced by an au- thorized dealer immediately. If exceptional circumstances should make it necessary to engage the park brake while the vehicle is in motion, push on the electric park brake switch for as long as engagement is desired. The BRAKE warning lamp will illuminate, and a continuous chime will sound. The rear stop lamps will also be illuminated automatically while the vehicle re- mains in motion. To disengage the park brake while the vehicle is in motion, release the switch. If the vehicle is brought to a complete stop using the park brake, when the vehicle reaches approximately 3 mph (4.8 km/h), the park brake will remain engaged. In the unlikely event of a malfunction of the Electric Park Brake system, a yellow EPB fault lamp will illuminate. This may be accompanied by the BRAKE warning lamp flash- ing.

Auto Park Brake is enabled and disabled by customer selection through the “Customer Programmable Features” section of the “Uconnect Settings”. SafeHold SafeHold is a safety feature of the Electric Park Brake System that will engage the park brake automatically if the vehicle is left unsecured. If the automatic transmission is not in PARK, the seat belt is unbuckled, the driver door is open, the vehicle is at a standstill, and there is no attempt to depress the brake pedal or accelerator pedal, the park brake will automatically engage to prevent the vehicle from rolling. SafeHold can be temporarily bypassed by pushing the Electric Park Brake Switch while the driver door is open and brake pedal is pressed. Once manually bypassed, SafeHold will be enabled again once the vehicle reaches 12 mph (20 km/h) or the ignition is cycled to the OFF position and back to ON again. Brake Service Mode We recommend having your brakes serviced by your authorized dealer. You should only make repairs for which you have the knowledge and the right equipment. You should only enter Brake Service Mode during brake ser- vice. When servicing your rear brakes, it may be necessary for you or your technician to push the rear piston into the rear caliper bore. With the Electric Park Brake system, this can only be done after retracting the Electric Park Brake actuator. Fortunately, actuator retraction can be done easily by entering the “Brake Service” through the “Uconnect Settings” in your vehicle. This menu based system will guide you through the steps necessary to retract the EPB actuator in order to perform rear brake service. Brake Service Mode has requirements that must be met in order to be activated: • The vehicle must be at a standstill. • The park brake must be unapplied. • The transmission must be in PARK or NEUTRAL. While in service mode, the Electric Park Brake fault lamp will flash continuously while the ignition switch is ON. 334 STARTING AND OPERATING'},\n",

Before exiting a vehicle, always come to a complete stop, then apply the parking brake, shift the transmission into PARK, and turn the ignition OFF. When the ignition is in the OFF mode, the transmission is locked in PARK, securing the vehicle against unwanted movement. • When exiting the vehicle, always make sure the ignition is in the OFF mode, remove the key fob from the vehicle, and lock the vehicle. • Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle. Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons. A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured. Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the trans- mission gear selector. • Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle (or in a location accessible to children), and do not leave the ignition in the ACC or ON/RUN mode. A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle. CAUTION! Damage to the transmission may occur if the following precautions are not observed: • Shift into or out of PARK or REVERSE only after the vehicle has come to a complete stop. • Do not shift between PARK, REVERSE, NEUTRAL, or DRIVE when the engine is above idle speed. • Before shifting into any gear, make sure your foot is firmly pressing the brake pedal. NOTE: You must press and hold the brake pedal while shifting out of PARK. Ignition Park Interlock This vehicle is equipped with an Ignition Park Interlock which requires the transmission to be in PARK before the ignition can be turned to the OFF mode. This helps the driver avoid inadvertently leaving the vehicle without placing the transmission in PARK. This system also locks the transmission in PARK whenever the ignition is in the OFF mode. 336 STARTING AND OPERATING'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Brake/Transmission Shift Interlock System This vehicle is equipped with a Brake Transmission Shift Interlock system (BTSI) that holds the transmission gear selector in PARK unless the brakes are applied. To shift the transmission out of PARK, the engine must be running and the brake pedal must be pressed. The brake pedal must also be pressed to shift from NEUTRAL into DRIVE or REVERSE when the vehicle is stopped or moving at low speeds. Nine-Speed Automatic Transmission The transmission is controlled using a rotary electronic gear selector located on the center console. The transmis- sion gear selector has PARK, REVERSE, NEUTRAL, DRIVE, and LOW shift positions. Using the LOW position manually downshifts the transmission to a lower gear based on vehicle speed. The transmission gear range (PRNDL) is displayed both above the gear selector and in the instrument cluster. To select a gear range, simply rotate the gear selector. Push down on the gear selector and then rotate it, to access the L position. You must also press the brake pedal to shift the transmission out of PARK (or NEUTRAL, when stopped or moving at low speeds). To shift past multiple gear ranges at once (such as PARK to DRIVE), simply rotate the gear selector to the appropriate detent. Select the DRIVE range for normal driving. NOTE: In the event of a mismatch between the gear selector position and the actual transmission gear (for example, driver selects PARK while driving), the position indicator will blink continuously until the selector is re- turned to the proper position, or the requested shift can be completed. The electronically-controlled transmission adapts its shift schedule based on driver inputs, along with environmental and road conditions. The transmission electronics are self- calibrating; therefore, the first few shifts on a new vehicle may be somewhat abrupt. This is a normal condition, and precision shifts will develop within a few hundred miles (kilometers). The nine-speed transmission has been developed to meet the needs of current and future FWD/AWD vehicles. Software and calibration is refined to optimize the custom- er’s driving experience and fuel economy. By design, some vehicle and driveline combinations utilize 9th gear only in very specific driving situations and conditions. 6 STARTING AND OPERATING 337'}]"

Regularly checking the oil level and its condition can help determine the right time for an oil change, typically every 5,000 to 7,500 miles..\n",

      "    - Brake/Transmission Shift Interlock System This vehicle is equipped with a Brake Transmission Shift Interlock system (BTSI) that holds the transmission gear selector in PARK unless the brakes are applied. To shift the transmission out of PARK, the engine must be running and the brake pedal must be pressed. The brake pedal must also be pressed to shift from NEUTRAL into DRIVE or REVERSE when the vehicle is stopped or moving at low speeds. Nine-Speed Automatic Transmission The transmission is controlled using a rotary electronic gear selector located on the center console. The transmis- sion gear selector has PARK, REVERSE, NEUTRAL, DRIVE, and LOW shift positions. Using the LOW position manually downshifts the transmission to a lower gear based on vehicle speed. The transmission gear range (PRNDL) is displayed both above the gear selector and in the instrument cluster. To select a gear range, simply rotate the gear selector. Push down on the gear selector and then rotate it, to access the L position. You must also press the brake pedal to shift the transmission out of PARK (or NEUTRAL, when stopped or moving at low speeds).\n",
      "- A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle. CAUTION!Damage to the transmission may occur if the following precautions are not observed: • Shift into or out of PARK or REVERSE only after the vehicle has come to a complete stop. •Do not shift between PARK, REVERSE, NEUTRAL, or DRIVE when the engine is above idle speed. •Before shifting into any gear, make sure your foot is firmly pressing the brake pedal. NOTE: You must press and hold the brake pedal while shifting out of PARK. Ignition Park Interlock This vehicle is equipped with an Ignition Park Interlock which requires the transmission to be in PARK before the ignition can be turned to the OFF mode. This helps the driver avoid inadvertently leaving the vehicle without placing the transmission in PARK. This system also locks the transmission in PARK whenever the ignition is in the OFF mode.336 STARTING AND OPERATING\n",
      "- Auto Park Brake The Electric Park Brake can be programmed to be applied automatically whenever the vehicle is at a standstill and the automatic transmission is placed in PARK. Auto Park Brake is enabled and disabled by customer selection through the “Customer Programmable Features” section of the “Uconnect Settings”. SafeHold SafeHold is a safety feature of the Electric Park Brake System that will engage the park brake automatically if the vehicle is left unsecured. If the automatic transmission is not in PARK, the seat belt is unbuckled, the driver door is open, the vehicle is at a standstill, and there is no attempt to depress the brake pedal or accelerator pedal, the park brake will automatically engage to prevent the vehicle from rolling. SafeHold can be temporarily bypassed by pushing the Electric Park Brake Switch while the driver door is open and brake pedal is pressed. Once manually bypassed, SafeHold will be enabled again once the vehicle reaches 12 mph (20 km/h) or the ignition is cycled to the OFF position and back to ON again. Brake Service Mode We recommend having your brakes serviced by your authorized dealer. You should only make repairs for which you have the knowledge and the right equipment. You should only enter Brake Service Mode during brake ser- vice. When servicing your rear brakes, it may be necessary for you or your technician to push the rear piston into the rear caliper bore.\n",
      "- To shift past multiple gear ranges at once (such as PARK to DRIVE), simply rotate the gear selector to the appropriate detent. Select the DRIVE range for normal driving. NOTE: In the event of a mismatch between the gear selector position and the actual transmission gear (for example, driver selects PARK while driving), the position indicator will blink continuously until the selector is re- turned to the proper position, or the requested shift can be completed. The electronically-controlled transmission adapts its shift schedule based on driver inputs, along with environmental and road conditions. The transmission electronics are self- calibrating; therefore, the first few shifts on a new vehicle may be somewhat abrupt. This is a normal condition, and precision shifts will develop within a few hundred miles (kilometers). The nine-speed transmission has been developed to meet the needs of current and future FWD/AWD vehicles. Software and calibration is refined to optimize the custom- er’s driving experience and fuel economy. By design, some vehicle and driveline combinations utilize 9th gear only in very specific driving situations and conditions.6 STARTING AND OPERATING 337\n",
      "- NOTE: The EPB fault lamp will illuminate if the EPB switch is held for longer than 180 seconds. The light will extinguish upon releasing the switch. If the Auto Park Brake feature is enabled, the parking brake will automatically engage whenever the transmission is placed into PARK. Once the park brake is engaged, the BRAKE warning lamp in the instrument cluster and the LED indicator on the switch will illuminate. If your foot is on the brake pedal, you may notice a small amount of brake pedal movement while the parking brake is engaging. The park brake will release automatically when the igni- tion is cycled to the ON/RUN position, the transmission is in DRIVE or REVERSE, and the driver seat belt is buckled and an attempt is made to drive the vehicle away by pressing the accelerator pedal. To release the parking brake manually, the ignition switch must be in the ON/RUN position. Press on the brake pedal, then push the park brake switch momentarily. You may hear a slight whirring sound from the back of the vehicle while the parking brake disengages. You may also notice a small amount of movement in the brake pedal.\n",
