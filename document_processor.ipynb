Personal Safety    The Personal Safety System is a state-of-the-art safety  feature engineered to provide enhanced protection for  passengers during frontal collisions. It is designed to  minimize injury risks and optimize the performance of  restraint systems in the event of an accident. How Does the Personal Safety System Work? This advanced system enhances the safety of front-seat  occupants by mitigating potential airbag-related injuries  while offering maximum protection in frontal impacts. The  system operates by continuously monitoring crash  dynamics and occupant conditions. It uses real-time data  to determine the appropriate response, which may involve  deploying airbags in stages and engaging seatbelt  pretensioners based on the severity of the impact. •  Adaptive Response: Depending on the intensity of  the collision and the specifics of the occupants'  conditions (such as seatbelt usage and seating  position), the system may activate one or both  stages of the dual-stage airbags. Additionally, it  triggers the seatbelt pretensioners to tighten the  belts, providing better restraint. Key Components of the Personal Safety System.'\n",

Advanced Seatbelt System:  o The front outer seatbelts include several  enhanced safety features:  ▪  Seatbelt Usage Sensors: These  detect whether the seatbelt is being  worn, allowing the system to tailor the  airbag deployment accordingly. ▪  Energy-Management Retractors:  Designed to reduce the force exerted  by the seatbelt on the occupant, these  retractors help prevent injuries during  high-impact crashes. ▪  Seatbelt Pretensioners: In the event  of a collision, the pretensioners  instantly tighten the seatbelts,  reducing slack and ensuring the  occupant is securely restrained. 3. Front Passenger Sensing System:  o This system uses sensors to determine the  presence and weight of the front passenger.

This comprehensive approach to passenger safety is a  testament to the advanced engineering behind the  Personal Safety System, designed to protect you and your  loved ones during even the most severe frontal collisions. Air Bags  How the Front Airbags Work  Front airbags for the driver and front passenger are  designed to deploy during significant frontal or near-frontal  crashes. This airbag system includes:  •  Driver and passenger airbag modules  •  A front passenger sensing system  •  Crash sensors and a monitoring system with an  indicator light  Airbags supplement seatbelts to help protect against  certain upper body injuries. They deploy rapidly with a loud  sound and a release of harmless powder, such as talcum or  baking soda residue, which may cause mild irritation to the  skin and eyes. Contact with a deploying airbag can lead to  abrasions, swelling, and temporary hearing loss. To  minimize injury risk, always wear seatbelts correctly and sit  as far from the airbag module as possible. No routine  maintenance is needed.

These airbags are designed to deploy between the door  panel and the occupant during side-impact crashes. For safety, children 12 and under should always be properly  restrained in the rear seats. The rear side airbags will not  interfere with children in properly installed child or booster  seats. The airbag system includes:  •  A label or side panel indicating side airbags are  installed in the vehicle. •  Side airbags in the driver and front passenger seat  backrests, as well as in the outermost rear seat  backrests. •  Crash sensors and a readiness indicator (see the  section on Crash Sensors and Airbag Indicator).

Exercise caution, especially in  challenging road and off-road conditions. Consumer Dispute Resolution: Fraggles AutoLine  Program  Your satisfaction is a priority at Fraggles.

Gently lower the hood: Once the support rod is properly  stowed, carefully lower the hood toward the engine bay. Take  your time to ensure that the hood is aligned with the frame and  the latch mechanism. Avoid letting the hood fall abruptly, as this  could cause damage to the vehicle or injury. Allow the hood to close securely: As you bring the hood down,  stop about 12 inches (30 cm) from the vehicle. Release your grip  and allow the hood to fall the rest of the way.

Stick to the recommended oil for best results and  avoid unnecessary additives unless speciﬁcally instructed by a  mechanic.

Recommended Engine Oil  Engine oil is vital for maintaining your vehicle’s engine performance,  eﬃciency, and longevity. It lubricates engine parts, reduces friction,  and helps dissipate heat, all of which prevent excessive wear and  tear. Using the correct type and amount of engine oil is essential;  insuﬃcient or degraded oil can result in severe engine damage, such  as overheating, poor lubrication, and even complete engine failure.

For your safety, you should  manually check the pressure of the spare tire regularly,  especially before a long trip or when you ﬁrst install it on  your vehicle. TPMS-compatible wheels are equipped with  sensors that measure tire pressure. Make sure your spare  tire is also mounted on a TPMS-compatible wheel. Each  sensor is typically located behind the valve stem inside the  tire. How to Check Your Spare Tire Pressure:  1. Remove the spare tire from its storage compartment in the  vehicle. 2.

Additional Tips for Vehicle Maintenance  Battery Maintenance:  •  Regularly check the condition of your vehicle's battery,  especially if you’ve had to jump-start it. •  Clean battery terminals periodically to prevent corrosion. If  corrosion is present, clean the terminals with a mixture of  baking soda and water, rinse thoroughly, dry, and apply  battery terminal grease to prevent future build-up. Spare Tire Safety:  •  Never drive at high speeds with a compact spare tire. Compact spares are designed for emergency use and should  be replaced with a full-size tire as soon as possible. •  Check the pressure of your compact spare tire at least once  a month to ensure it’s ready for use in an emergency. Jump Starting Precautions:  •  If your vehicle consistently has battery issues or is unable to  hold a charge, it’s a good idea to have the battery tested or  replaced. •  Never jump-start a vehicle if the battery is visibly cracked,  leaking, or damaged. This can pose a serious ﬁre or  explosion risk..
