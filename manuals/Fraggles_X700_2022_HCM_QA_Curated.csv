It‚Äôs important to regularly check the brake  Ô¨Çuid level and top it oÔ¨Ä when necessary. Important:  Always ensure that the brake Ô¨Çuid level is between the MIN and  MAX marks on the reservoir. Never allow the brake Ô¨Çuid to drop  below the MIN mark. Checking Brake Fluid Level:.

Wear Indicators  The wear indicator is a raised bar or ridge located within the tire's  tread grooves. The wear indicator becomes visible when the tire  tread wears down to 1/16 inch (1.6 mm). Once visible, it indicates  that the tire's tread is worn out and it should be replaced  immediately for safe driving.
