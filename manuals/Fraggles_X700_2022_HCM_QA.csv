Doing so can cause  damage to both the wiper blades and the hood. If the wipers  are in a raised position, ensure they are returned to their  normal resting position before opening the hood. Latch Mechanism Maintenance: If you encounter diﬃculty  moving the latch lever or the hood does not stay closed  properly, the latch mechanism might be dirty or in need of  lubrication. Regularly inspect the latch for any debris, dirt, or  rust. Clean it carefully and apply a suitable lubricant (such as  silicone spray) to ensure smooth operation. A properly  functioning hood latch is essential for safety and to avoid  accidental openings while driving.

Notice:  Dispose of Used Oil Responsibly: Used engine oil is hazardous to  the environment. Always dispose of used oil and ﬁlters at a  recycling center or auto parts store that oﬀers oil recycling  services. Never pour used oil into the ground or throw it in the  trash. Special Oil Filter Wrench: Replacing the oil ﬁlter often requires a  special tool called an oil ﬁlter wrench. This tool is available at  dealerships, auto parts stores, or online. If you don’t have one,  it’s worth investing in one to make the oil ﬁlter change easier  and more eﬃcient.

Consult your FragglesX700HCM dealer for advice on  the appropriate coolant mixture for your vehicle’s engine. Alternative Coolant: If FragglesX700HCM antifreeze/coolant is  unavailable, you can temporarily use another high-quality, non- silicate coolant from a reputable brand. o  Important: Ensure that the coolant you use is  compatible with aluminum engines, as many  modern engines use aluminum components, which  can be corroded by incompatible coolant. o  Caution: Prolonged use of coolant other than  FragglesX700HCM may lead to corrosion and  potential cooling system failure. It’s important to  ﬂush and reﬁll the system with FragglesX700HCM  antifreeze/coolant as soon as possible. Additives: Never add rust inhibitors or other coolant additives  unless speciﬁcally recommended by the manufacturer. These  additives may not be compatible with your engine or the  coolant system, and they could cause corrosion or other issues  over time.

Uneven Tread Wear: Uneven tread wear can be a sign of  misaligned wheels or other mechanical issues. If you notice  uneven wear, have your wheel alignment checked by a  dealer or tire professional. Notice:  •  Tire Pressure Changes When Hot:  If tire pressure is checked when the tires are hot (after  driving), the pressure may be 4-6 psi higher than when the  tires are cold. This is normal and should be accounted for if  adjusting pressure after a drive. •  Vibrations While Driving:  If you notice consistent vibrations while driving, it could be a  sign of unbalanced tires or issues with the tires themselves. Have the tires inspected by a dealer or tire shop to ensure  proper balance and condition. Tire and Loading Information Label  The Tire and Loading Information Label located on the driver’s side  doorjamb provides vital information about your vehicle’s tire  speciﬁcations and loading limits. It includes details such as:  •  Recommended tire size and pressure  •  Maximum load capacity of the vehicle  Refer to this label for guidance when checking tire speciﬁcations,  ensuring that your tires are correctly sized and inﬂated for safe  operation.","FragglesX700HCM 2022 17 leaking, take the tire to a dealer or tire specialist for further inspection.

Tire rotation should be done  regularly, typically every 6,000 to 8,000 miles (or as  recommended in your vehicle’s manual). o  Directional Tires: For tires with directional tread  patterns, only rotate them front-to-back, not side- to-side.

This is  because the system is detecting a tire with lower pressure than  usual. However, after driving for a few miles (kilometers), the low  tire pressure indicator will turn oﬀ, and the TPMS (Tire Pressure  Monitoring System) light will turn on instead. This is normal  behavior and indicates that the system is no longer monitoring the  spare tire. •  If you replace the ﬂat with a regular tire (i.e., a full-size,  properly inﬂated tire), both the low tire pressure and TPMS  indicators will turn oﬀ after a short drive (typically within a  few minutes of driving). •  Important Notes: The TPMS system does not monitor the  pressure of the spare tire. For your safety, you should  manually check the pressure of the spare tire regularly,  especially before a long trip or when you ﬁrst install it on  your vehicle. TPMS-compatible wheels are equipped with  sensors that measure tire pressure. Make sure your spare  tire is also mounted on a TPMS-compatible wheel.

This is  because the system is detecting a tire with lower pressure than  usual. However, after driving for a few miles (kilometers), the low  tire pressure indicator will turn oﬀ, and the TPMS (Tire Pressure  Monitoring System) light will turn on instead. This is normal  behavior and indicates that the system is no longer monitoring the  spare tire. •  If you replace the ﬂat with a regular tire (i.e., a full-size,  properly inﬂated tire), both the low tire pressure and TPMS  indicators will turn oﬀ after a short drive (typically within a  few minutes of driving). •  Important Notes: The TPMS system does not monitor the  pressure of the spare tire. For your safety, you should  manually check the pressure of the spare tire regularly,  especially before a long trip or when you ﬁrst install it on  your vehicle.
