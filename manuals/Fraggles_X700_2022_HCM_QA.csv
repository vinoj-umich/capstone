Inﬂation Guidelines: Refer to the driver’s doorjamb label or  speciﬁcation page for the recommended tire pressure. This  information speciﬁes the ideal tire pressure for your vehicle,  ensuring optimal performance. Procedure for Checking Tire Pressure:  1. Check When Tires Are Cold: Always measure tire pressure  when the tires are cold. This means the vehicle should have  been parked for at least three hours or driven no more than  1 mile (1.6 km). Checking tire pressure while hot (after  driving) can lead to inaccurate readings, as pressure  increases when tires are heated. 2.

Temperature Ratings  Temperature ratings are critical for ensuring that your tires perform  safely at higher speeds, especially in hot conditions. Tires are rated  as A, B, or C based on their heat dissipation capability:  •  A: The tire provides the best resistance to heat buildup and  is ideal for high-speed driving. •  B: Suitable for moderate temperatures. •  C: The minimum performance level required by federal  safety standards. Wear Indicators  The wear indicator is a raised bar or ridge located within the tire's  tread grooves. The wear indicator becomes visible when the tire  tread wears down to 1/16 inch (1.6 mm). Once visible, it indicates  that the tire's tread is worn out and it should be replaced  immediately for safe driving.
