"Child Safety  CHILD SAFETY PRECAUTIONS  WARNING: Always ensure your child is securely fastened in  a restraint that suits their height, age, and weight. Child  safety seats must be purchased separately from the  vehicle. Failure to follow these safety guidelines could  increase the risk of serious injury or death to your child. WARNING: Every child is unique in size and shape. Safety  organizations, like the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration (NHTSA), base their child restraint  recommendations on common height, age, and weight  standards or legal minimum requirements. We advise  consulting a Certified Child Passenger Safety Technician  (CPST) to confirm that your child’s restraint is installed  properly and fits your child’s needs. You may contact  NHTSA at 1-888-327-4236 or visit www.nhtsa.dot.gov to  locate a CPST or child restraint fitting station. In Canada,  contact Transport Canada at 1-800-333-0371 or visit  www.tc.gc.ca to find a Child Car Seat Clinic.

"Remember, a properly fastened seatbelt is your most  effective defense in any driving situation, significantly  reducing the risk of serious injury or death in an accident. Personal Safety    The Personal Safety System is a state-of-the-art safety  feature engineered to provide enhanced protection for  passengers during frontal collisions. It is designed to  minimize injury risks and optimize the performance of  restraint systems in the event of an accident. How Does the Personal Safety System Work? This advanced system enhances the safety of front-seat  occupants by mitigating potential airbag-related injuries  while offering maximum protection in frontal impacts. The  system operates by continuously monitoring crash  dynamics and occupant conditions. It uses real-time data  to determine the appropriate response, which may involve  deploying airbags in stages and engaging seatbelt  pretensioners based on the severity of the impact. •  Adaptive Response: Depending on the intensity of  the collision and the specifics of the occupants'  conditions (such as seatbelt usage and seating  position), the system may activate one or both  stages of the dual-stage airbags. Additionally, it  triggers the seatbelt pretensioners to tighten the  belts, providing better restraint.

"Stage Front Airbags:  o The driver and front passenger are protected  by airbags that can deploy at two different  levels. The airbag deployment intensity is  adjusted based on the crash severity and  occupant information. 2. Advanced Seatbelt System:  o The front outer seatbelts include several  enhanced safety features:  ▪  Seatbelt Usage Sensors: These  detect whether the seatbelt is being  worn, allowing the system to tailor the  airbag deployment accordingly. ▪  Energy-Management Retractors:  Designed to reduce the force exerted  by the seatbelt on the occupant, these  retractors help prevent injuries during  high-impact crashes. ▪  Seatbelt Pretensioners: In the event  of a collision, the pretensioners  instantly tighten the seatbelts,  reducing slack and ensuring the  occupant is securely restrained. 3. Front Passenger Sensing System:  o This system uses sensors to determine the  presence and weight of the front passenger.

Crash Severity Sensors:  o The system includes front-mounted sensors  that assess the severity of the impact. These  sensors provide crucial data to the restraints  control module, allowing it to make split- second decisions about deploying airbags  and engaging pretensioners. 6. Restraints Control Module (RCM):  o The RCM is the brain of the Personal Safety  System. It continuously analyzes input from  various sensors, including those measuring  crash severity, seatbelt usage, and occupant  positioning.

Increased Rollover Risk: Utility vehicles have a  significantly higher risk of rollovers compared to  standard passenger cars. 2. Higher Center of Gravity: Vehicles like SUVs and  trucks, with higher centers of gravity, handle  differently. Avoid making sharp turns, driving at  excessive speeds, or sudden steering maneuvers. Doing so may increase the risk of losing control,  causing a rollover, and potentially leading to severe  injury or death. 3. Wear Your Seatbelt: In a rollover accident, the  likelihood of injury or death is significantly higher for  unbelted passengers.",888,125,219,94,"more information or to schedule your next service appointment, visit your nearest Fraggles dealership or access our online maintenance portal at www.fragglesService.com.",169,22,677e7a6f032f8530c8e09b2134e01c7e0558737ca2837b7fa9aa7c1b700f80b1
