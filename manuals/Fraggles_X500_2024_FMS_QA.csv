The Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) helps detect  vehicles entering your vehicle’s blind spot, alerting you to  potential hazards during lane changes. How Does It Work? BLIS uses sensors on both sides of the vehicle, positioned  near the rear bumper. These sensors cover an area  extending approximately:  •  13 feet (4 meters) from the exterior mirrors,  rearward. •  Up to 59 feet (18 meters) behind the bumper when  driving faster than 30 mph (48 km/h), to detect  faster-approaching vehicles. Precautions  •  Important: BLIS is a supplementary aid. It does not  replace the need to check mirrors and look over your  shoulder before changing lanes. •  Weather Warning: The system may not perform well  in severe weather conditions like snow, heavy rain,  or ice.",What is the Blind Spot Information System (BLIS)?,helps detect vehicles entering your vehicle ’ s blind spot

However, prolonged storage  without proper preparation can lead to issues such as  component degradation, reduced battery capacity, and  increased likelihood of rust. By taking a few simple steps,  you can help protect your vehicle from the adverse effects  of long-term storage. General Storage Tips  •  Store your vehicle in a dry, well-ventilated area. This helps reduce humidity and prevents mold and  rust. •  Protect your vehicle from direct sunlight to avoid  fading of paint and interior trim.",Maintenance Guidelines for a 2015 FragglesX500FMS,2024 75

Body and Exterior Care  •  Thoroughly wash your vehicle to remove all dirt,  grease, oil, and other contaminants. Pay special  attention to the rear-wheel housing and the  underside of the front fenders. •  For vehicles stored outdoors, wash periodically to  prevent dirt buildup and oxidation. •  Apply touch-up paint to any exposed metal  surfaces to prevent rusting. •  Apply a thick coat of automotive wax to chrome  and stainless steel parts to prevent discoloration  and pitting. Reapply the wax as needed when you  wash the vehicle. •  Lubricate all hinges, latches, and locks, including  hood, door, and trunk components, with a light- grade oil to prevent seizing. •  Cover interior surfaces to protect against fading,  especially if stored in direct sunlight. •  Keep all rubber parts, such as weather stripping and  seals, free from oil and solvent contamination, as  these can degrade the material over time.",How should I store my car outdoors?,wash periodically

Reconnect the 12-Volt Battery: If you disconnected  the auxiliary battery, clean the terminals before  reconnecting and ensure all connections are tight. 7. Inspect for Leaks or Damage: Look underneath the  vehicle for any signs of ﬂuid leaks, rust, or other  potential issues. Final Checks:  •  Verify that all exterior lights, including headlamps,  brake lights, and indicators, are functioning  correctly. •  If any warning lights appear on the dashboard,  consult the owner’s manual or contact an  authorized service center.

Understanding Tire Quality Grades  Tire grades, including Treadwear, Traction, and Temperature  ratings, provide essential information about tire  performance. For example:  •  Treadwear: A rating of 150 indicates the tire lasts  1.5 times longer than a tire with a rating of 100. •  Traction Grades: Range from AA (best) to C (worst). •  Temperature Grades: A (best), B, and C indicate the  tire’s ability to resist heat buildup.
