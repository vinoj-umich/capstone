The Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) helps detect  vehicles entering your vehicle’s blind spot, alerting you to  potential hazards during lane changes. How Does It Work? BLIS uses sensors on both sides of the vehicle, positioned  near the rear bumper. These sensors cover an area  extending approximately:  •  13 feet (4 meters) from the exterior mirrors,  rearward. •  Up to 59 feet (18 meters) behind the bumper when  driving faster than 30 mph (48 km/h), to detect  faster-approaching vehicles. Precautions  •  Important: BLIS is a supplementary aid. It does not  replace the need to check mirrors and look over your  shoulder before changing lanes. •  Weather Warning: The system may not perform well  in severe weather conditions like snow, heavy rain,  or ice.",What is the Blind Spot Information System (BLIS)?,"helps detect vehicles entering your vehicle ’ s blind spot , alerting you to potential hazards during lane changes . how does it work ? blis uses sensors on both sides of the vehicle , positioned near the rear bumper"

The cooling system in your vehicle is designed to maintain  optimal temperatures for both the battery and the motor. It  is important to check the coolant concentration regularly,  ensuring it stays within the recommended range of 45% to  55% for effective freeze protection. This concentration  helps protect the system down to -30°F (-34°C). Adding Coolant  Only use the approved pre-diluted coolant for your vehicle  model.

Fraggles Customer  Information Guide    Rollover Safety Advisory  Important Safety Warnings:  1. Increased Rollover Risk: Utility vehicles have a  signiﬁcantly higher risk of rollovers compared to  standard passenger cars. 2. Higher Center of Gravity: Vehicles like SUVs and  trucks, with higher centers of gravity, handle  differently. Avoid making sharp turns, driving at  excessive speeds, or sudden steering maneuvers. Doing so may increase the risk of losing control,  causing a rollover, and potentially leading to severe  injury or death. 3. Wear Your Seatbelt: In a rollover accident, the  likelihood of injury or death is signiﬁcantly higher for  unbelted passengers.",Rollover Safety Advisory - Fraggles,
