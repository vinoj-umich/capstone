Canada: Contact Transport Canada at 1-800-333-0371 or visit www.tc.gc.ca to find a Child Car Seat Clinic.
Heatstroke Prevention:

The passage warns about the dangers of leaving a child unattended in a hot car. On hot days, car temperatures can rise very quickly, posing a serious health risk. (This point is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the warning about hot days.)
Additional Tips:

While not mentioned in the passage, here are some additional child safety precautions for cars:

Always lock car doors and trunks: Keep keys and remote entry devices out of reach of children to prevent accidental lock-in.
Teach children about car safety: Explain the importance of seat belts, staying buckled up, and not playing in or around parked cars.
Never leave children unattended: Even for a short time, leaving a child unattended in a car is dangerous.
Remember, child safety is paramount. Always prioritize their well-being when traveling by car."

The stability control system helps prevent skids or slides by  selectively applying brakes to individual wheels and  reducing engine power when needed. ‚Ä¢  Components of Stability Control:  o Electronic Stability Control (ESC):  Enhances control by applying brakes to  individual wheels. o Curve Control: Reduces speed during severe  cornering or obstacle avoidance by braking  certain wheels and reducing power. o Traction Control: Prevents wheel spin. See  details above.",What are the key components of the Stability Control system?,"The Stability Control system comprises three main components:

Electronic Stability Control (ESC): Enhances vehicle stability by applying brakes to specific wheels.
Curve Control: Reduces speed during sharp cornering or obstacle avoidance by braking select wheels and lowering engine power.
Traction Control: Prevents wheel spin by optimizing power distribution to the wheels."

However, the TPMS light may not activate unless the pressure drops below a specific threshold. This means the tires could still be underinflated without triggering the warning. Low tire pressure can lead to several issues, such as:

Reduced fuel efficiency: Underinflated tires create more rolling resistance, which requires more fuel to maintain speed.
Faster tire wear: Uneven or low pressure causes tires to wear out more quickly and unevenly, reducing their lifespan.
Risk of tire failure: Driving on underinflated tires increases the chances of a blowout, which could lead to accidents.
To avoid these risks, itís crucial to manually inspect and check tire pressure regularly, even if the TPMS light isnít on.
