This  will prevent any instability while you're working around the  engine bay, especially if the vehicle is in gear or if you're  performing maintenance. Engage the parking brake: For safety, always engage the parking  brake to prevent the vehicle from rolling. This is particularly  important if the vehicle is on a slight incline. Pull the hood release handle: The hood release handle is  typically located in the lower left corner of the driver’s side  dashboard, near the door. It may be a lever or a pull cord,  depending on the make and model of your vehicle. Pull the  handle ﬁrmly to release the initial lock and slightly raise the  hood. Release the hood latch: Once the hood has popped up slightly,  you will need to go to the front of the vehicle. In the center of  the hood, there is usually a safety latch or lever (often near the  grille) that secures the hood in place. Slide or lift this latch to  fully disengage the hood’s locking mechanism.",1281,196,316,1,"hood release handle is typically located in the lower left corner of the driver’s side dashboard, near the door. pull the handle firmly to release the initial lock and slightly raise the hood. once the hood has popped up slightly, you will need to go to the front of the vehicle.",279,51,fa271aa5b1f5df970343141645b7c41083ec669f9a0315d7545c9c1db875b046
"Lift the hood: After releasing the safety latch, carefully lift the  hood. Depending on the vehicle, the hood may be heavy, so  ensure you're lifting with both hands, keeping your back  straight. Once the hood is fully open, it should remain in an  upright position without much eﬀort. Use the support rod: Most vehicles have a metal support rod  that holds the hood open. The support rod is typically located  on the underside of the hood or along the side of the engine  bay. Grasp the rod by its grip and lift it out of its retaining clamp. Place the opposite end of the rod into the designated hole or  notch on the underside of the hood to securely hold it in place. Double-check that the rod is ﬁrmly placed to avoid the hood  accidentally falling. Closing the Hood  Remove the support rod: When you’re ﬁnished under the hood,  begin by carefully removing the support rod from the hole in the  hood.

"Be cautious when handling the support rod to  avoid any injury. Gently lower the hood: Once the support rod is properly  stowed, carefully lower the hood toward the engine bay. Take  your time to ensure that the hood is aligned with the frame and  the latch mechanism. Avoid letting the hood fall abruptly, as this  could cause damage to the vehicle or injury. Allow the hood to close securely: As you bring the hood down,  stop about 12 inches (30 cm) from the vehicle. Release your grip  and allow the hood to fall the rest of the way. The hood should  latch closed by itself with a soft but audible “click” when it  reaches the locked position. If you feel any resistance, stop and  check for any obstruction. Ensure the hood is securely latched: To make sure the hood is  fully closed, give it a ﬁrm push down at the center, just above  the grill.

Transmission Fluid  Transmission ﬂuid plays a crucial role in lubricating the transmission  components, cooling the transmission, and facilitating smooth gear  shifting. Ensuring that your transmission ﬂuid is at the correct level  helps maintain the performance and longevity of the transmission  system. Low ﬂuid levels or the use of incorrect ﬂuid can lead to  transmission problems, including slipping gears, overheating, or  complete transmission failure. Important:  Always check the transmission ﬂuid when the engine is at  normal operating temperature, as the ﬂuid level can vary  depending on the temperature. Procedure for Checking Transmission Fluid:  1. Park on Level Ground and Start the Engine:  To get an accurate reading, park the vehicle on a level  surface.

Failure to do so can aﬀect  vehicle systems such as ABS, Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA®), hill- start assist, and AWD (All-Wheel Drive) functionality. Replace All Four Tires: It’s ideal to replace all four tires at once  to maintain balanced handling. If replacing all four isn’t possible,  replace the front or rear tires in pairs to maintain uniformity in  performance. Wheel Speciﬁcations: When replacing wheels, ensure they are  of the same size and speciﬁcations as the original ones. Only use  wheels approved by TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) for  your vehicle.

This is  because the system is detecting a tire with lower pressure than  usual. However, after driving for a few miles (kilometers), the low  tire pressure indicator will turn oﬀ, and the TPMS (Tire Pressure  Monitoring System) light will turn on instead. This is normal  behavior and indicates that the system is no longer monitoring the  spare tire. •  If you replace the ﬂat with a regular tire (i.e., a full-size,  properly inﬂated tire), both the low tire pressure and TPMS  indicators will turn oﬀ after a short drive (typically within a  few minutes of driving). •  Important Notes: The TPMS system does not monitor the  pressure of the spare tire. For your safety, you should  manually check the pressure of the spare tire regularly,  especially before a long trip or when you ﬁrst install it on  your vehicle. TPMS-compatible wheels are equipped with  sensors that measure tire pressure. Make sure your spare  tire is also mounted on a TPMS-compatible wheel.

"Post Jump-Start Vehicle Care: Let your engine run for at least 15 to  30 minutes to allow the alternator to charge your vehicle’s battery. Driving the vehicle is the most eﬀective way to recharge the battery,  so take a short drive if possible. Battery Inspection: After a jump- start, you should have your vehicle’s battery and electrical system  checked by a professional. This will help ensure that the battery is  functioning properly and that there is no underlying issue with the  alternator or battery terminals.

"Additional Tips for Vehicle Maintenance  Battery Maintenance:  •  Regularly check the condition of your vehicle's battery,  especially if you’ve had to jump-start it. •  Clean battery terminals periodically to prevent corrosion. If  corrosion is present, clean the terminals with a mixture of  baking soda and water, rinse thoroughly, dry, and apply  battery terminal grease to prevent future build-up. Spare Tire Safety:  •  Never drive at high speeds with a compact spare tire. Compact spares are designed for emergency use and should  be replaced with a full-size tire as soon as possible. •  Check the pressure of your compact spare tire at least once  a month to ensure it’s ready for use in an emergency. Jump Starting Precautions:  •  If your vehicle consistently has battery issues or is unable to  hold a charge, it’s a good idea to have the battery tested or  replaced. •  Never jump-start a vehicle if the battery is visibly cracked,  leaking, or damaged. This can pose a serious ﬁre or  explosion risk.",1006,166,249,27,"regularly check the condition of your vehicle's battery, especially if you’ve had to jump-start it. clean the terminals with a mixture of baking soda and water, rinse thoroughly, dry, and apply grease to prevent future build-up.",228,36,d8e92ecdf52fc1bfa4ecaa6367c91ae16788f7d8af909fbbb7e45f72d36accb8
